# Exercise Instructions

For this exercise, you will be creating a system to catalog items in a store. The store sells all kinds of goods (movies, books, foodstuffs, etc), and needs to keep track of current inventory, pricing, and any items which are on layaway. Additionally, each item should have a category to determine which area of the store it's located in.

When the application is completed it will do the following:

* Render the current items in the store along with their price and inventory.
* Allow comments to be added to any item (user authentication is unnecessary).
* Add a new item to the catalog.
* At least one of these interactions should use Angular.

We would like you to do the following:

* Create a data architecture to support the requirements mentioned in the instructions. There should be database migrations for the tables, and laravel Models to interact with those tables.
* Demonstrate using Laravel controllers and views to render pages.
* Demonstrate Using Angular to change page display elements.
* Please comment your code as you see appropriate.
* When you are done, commit the code to a GitHub repository, and share the link 

Things to note:

* We have intentionally introduced at least one error in the code, so please address any bugs that you had to fix in your comments or overall explanation.
  * This could also be in the build pipeline.
